### A temperature dashboard built with Django

This dashboard application was created with the intent to practice django and implement a dashboard for a IoT device.
The device was created to measure the temperature on a city in the middle of the Amazon rain forest, which is a very hot place, like very hot and with virtually the same temperature the entire year.


Other measurements were taken, like the temperature in a barbecue grill.

**City**: Cacoal, state of Rond√¥nia, Brazil
